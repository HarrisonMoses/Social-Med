        background: "Smallholder farmers in Uganda face significant challenges in optimizing crop yields due to limited access to real-time soil data. Without precise information on soil nutrient levels, moisture, and temperature, they often rely on guesswork for fertilizer application, irrigation, and crop selection. This leads to inefficient use of resources, poor agricultural productivity, and soil degradation. There is a critical need for a system that collects, analyzes, and interprets soil data to provide actionable insights and recommendations for sustainable and efficient farming practices."
